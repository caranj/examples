## Goal 

Stick to the KISS principle and that ain't easy nowadays. 

[Quote From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle): 

> The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
